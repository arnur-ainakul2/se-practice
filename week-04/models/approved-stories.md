# Approved stories — Smart Campus study room booking

**Source of this set:** Reference set (provided in lab instructions)

## Scenario (from the Lesson 04 practice deck, slide 7)

Students view room availability, book a room, and cancel their own bookings. Administrators block
or unblock rooms and review usage.

- **R1** Future start, with duration greater than 0 and at most 2 hours.
- **R2** Active bookings for the same room cannot overlap.
- **R3** A blocked room cannot accept a new booking.
- **R4** A successful booking produces a confirmation.
