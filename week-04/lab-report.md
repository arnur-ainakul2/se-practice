# Week 04 — Lab report: Modeling the System with UML

> The single worksheet for this lab. Fill in every section. **Do not delete, rename or renumber

## 2. Prompts as sent

Paste every prompt **exactly as you sent it**, in the order you sent it, one code block each. The
AI's first replies are saved as files in `models/original/` — do not paste them here.

### 2.1 Task 1 — use-case prompt

```text
This is the Smart Campus scenario, its rules R1-R4 and my approved user stories. I will ask you for several UML diagrams in PlantUML. Use only this scenario. Wait for my first request.

# Approved stories — Smart Campus study room booking

**Source of this set:** Reference set (provided in lab instructions)

## Scenario (from the Lesson 04 practice deck, slide 7)

Students view room availability, book a room, and cancel their own bookings. Administrators block or unblock rooms and review usage.

- **R1** Future start, with duration greater than 0 and at most 2 hours.
- **R2** Active bookings for the same room cannot overlap.
- **R3** A blocked room cannot accept a new booking.
- **R4** A successful booking produces a confirmation.

## Reference set

| ID | Story | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| US-01 | As a student, I want to book a free study room for a time slot, so that I have a place to work, and I get a confirmation when the booking succeeds. | R1, R2, R3, R4 |
| US-02 | As a student, I want to see which rooms are free at a given time, so that I can choose one before booking. | — |
| US-03 | As a student, I want to cancel one of my own bookings, so that the room is released for others. | R2 |
| US-04 | As an administrator, I want to block a room, so that no new bookings can be made for it. | R3 |
| US-05 | As an administrator, I want to unblock a room, so that students can book it again. | R3 |
| US-06 | As an administrator, I want to review how rooms are used, so that I can plan capacity. | — |

**Out of scope** (do not model): payments, equipment in rooms, recurring bookings, waiting lists, notifications other than the booking confirmation, user registration.


Using the supplied scenario and approved stories, generate PlantUML for a use-case diagram. Include Student and Administrator outside a named system boundary. Model their goals, show justified associations, and list assumptions. Use include or extend only with a clear reason.

## 3. Task 1 — use-case review

**Assumptions the AI listed:** The AI listed none.

At least **two** findings. A finding names the element, the problem and the rule or story that proves it is a problem.

| # | Element | Problem | Rule or story | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `UC_Book .> UC_Confirm : <<include>>` | Missing mandatory `' why: <reason>` comment line directly above the `<<include>>` relationship. | PlantUML syntax rules (§4) & validator rules | Added `' why: R4 explicitly mandates producing a booking confirmation upon every successful room reservation (US-01)` directly above the relationship. |
| 2 | `rectangle "Smart Campus System"` | System boundary name was generic and failed to match the exact specified boundary name from the prompt. | Task 1 prompt instructions ("Smart Campus Study Room Booking") | Renamed boundary rectangle to `rectangle "Smart Campus Study Room Booking"`. |
| 3 | `usecase "Issue Confirmation\n(US-01 / R4)"` | Modelled as a standalone primary use case instead of an automated system side-effect resulting from booking. | US-04 & Scope rules (Confirmations are system outputs of US-01) | Kept as an included sub-usecase with an explicit `' why:` domain rationale comment explaining that it is a mandatory system side-effect of R4/US-01. |

## 4. Task 2 — class diagram review

### 4.1 Relationships, read both ways

One row per association in your **revised** class diagram.

| Association | Read left → right | Read right → left | Multiplicities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <Student — Booking> | <one student makes 0..* bookings> | <each booking belongs to exactly 1 student> | <1 / 0..*> |
| <Room — Booking> | <...> | <...> | <...> |

### 4.2 Constraints the multiplicities cannot show

- R2: <how your diagram states it — which note, on which class>
- <any other rule that is not visible in multiplicities>

### 4.3 Assumptions

- A1: <an assumption you had to make — e.g. what happens to existing bookings when a room is blocked>
- <A2 ...>

### 4.4 Findings

| # | Element | Problem | Rule or story | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | <element> | <problem> | <rule or story> | <fix> |

---

## 5. Task 3 — behaviour diagram review

**Option chosen and why:** <3A sequence / 3B activity — one sentence on why>

**Design components added beyond the domain model:** <name each one, e.g. `BookingService` —
what it does in one line; write "none" for an activity diagram>

| # | Element | Problem | Rule or story | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | <element> | <problem> | <rule or story> | <fix> |

---

## 6. AI critique

Run the critique prompt once, on all your revised diagrams together. At least **three** rows. A
critique is another claim to evaluate, not a verdict: reject what is wrong and say why.

| # | Issue the AI raised | Element it cited | Verdict | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | <issue> | <element> | <accept / reject> | <your reason> |
| 2 | <issue> | <element> | <accept / reject> | <your reason> |
| 3 | <issue> | <element> | <accept / reject> | <your reason> |

---

## 7. Consistency table

One row for each of **R1–R4**, then one row for **every use case in your revised use-case
diagram**, spelled exactly as in the diagram, with the story ID it traces to.

| Requirement / story | Use case | Classes | Behaviour element |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | <use case> | <classes and attributes> | <message, guard or decision> |
| R2 | <use case> | <classes, note> | <message, guard or decision> |
| R3 | <use case> | <classes and attributes> | <message, guard or decision> |
| R4 | <use case> | <classes> | <message or action> |
| <US-01> | <Book room> | <Student, Booking, Room> | <message or action> |

---

## 8. Change log

At least **three** rows, and at least one for each required diagram (use case, class, your
behaviour diagram). "Before" is what the AI produced; "After" is what you submitted.

| # | Diagram | Before (AI's original) | After (your revision) | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | <use case> | <before> | <after> | <rule, story or notation reason> |
| 2 | <class> | <before> | <after> | <reason> |
| 3 | <sequence / activity> | <before> | <after> | <reason> |

---

## 9. Checker output

Paste the complete output of `python tests/check_models.py`, then explain **every FAIL you are
keeping**. The same IDs go in `submission.yml` under `checker.kept_fails`. A FAIL you report and explain costs you nothing. One you hide costs the whole criterion.

```text
<paste the full output>
```

**FAILs I am keeping, and why:** <one line per check ID, or "none">

---

## 10. Conclusion (120–180 words)

<Which diagram did the AI get most wrong, and what exactly was wrong? Which error would have
reached the code if nobody had reviewed it? What did the critique find that you missed — and what
did it claim that was false? Be specific: "the AI got the multiplicities wrong" is worth nothing;
"the AI put 1..* on the Booking end, which says every room must already have a booking" is worth
everything.>
