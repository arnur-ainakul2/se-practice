# SIS #01 — Software Engineering Fundamentals, With an AI in the Loop

<!--
  This is the only file you write your report in. README.md tells you what goes where.

  Rules the checker relies on:
  - Do not delete, rename or renumber the ## headings, the ### headings, or the **Label:** words.
  - Replace every "(write here)" and "(paste here)". None may be left when you submit.
  - Comments like this one are ignored by the word counter. Delete them or leave them.

**Topic:** 1.3

## 1. Scenario

<!-- 100–150 words, labels included. One small scenario, used in every prompt and in your
     whole answer. Anything fictional is labelled in Assumptions. -->

**Question:** Does generating a study-materials exchange with AI in hours really lower its total cost over its life, compared with slower engineering methods such as requirements, tests and backups?

**Users:** Students who upload, search and download study materials; one student administrator who removes wrong files.

**Problem:** A generated upload-and-search feature can work in a demo yet fail in real use: duplicate files, wrong categories, unusable search results. The cost then appears later as repair work.

**Constraints:** (1) A small student team with no tester and a budget for only one protective measure. (2) Categories and file formats change every semester.

**Risk:** The file collection and its database are encrypted or deleted, and students lose their notes shortly before an exam.

**Assumptions:** (Fictional) About 800 students use the system; 40 files are uploaded weekly; repairing one bad upload takes an administrator 20 minutes.

## 2. Analysis

<!-- 350–400 words. Your answer to the question, the trade-offs, and how it applies to your
     scenario. Explain at least two engineering decisions and why they fit the scenario. -->

(write here)

## 3. Review

<!-- 250–300 words. What Prompt B's critique said and what you did with it; your two source
     checks and your two substantive revisions, each with a reason. Point at the rows of the
     tables in section 9 ("verification row 2", "change-log row 1"). -->

(write here)

## 4. Conclusion

<!-- 100–150 words. Your recommendation for the scenario and its main limitation. -->

(write here)

## 5. Reflection

<!-- 150–200 words. NOT part of the main total. Written by you, not by the assistant:
     what helped, what you changed, what you learned. Specific beats flattering. -->

(write here)

## 6. References

<!-- Full references, one per line, each starting with "- ". Only sources you actually opened.
     Every URL used in the verification table must also appear here. Example:
     - Sommerville, I. (2016). Software Engineering, 10th ed., Global Edition. Pearson. Ch. 1.

## 7. Appendix A — Initial outline

<!-- Written BEFORE you run Prompt A. Five points, your own words, numbered. These are the
     "five points" you paste into Prompt A. -->

1. Costs after launch come mostly from fixing the consequences of errors and from building features
   that nobody needs; a test audience is needed to check whether a feature is useful.
2. An AI assistant lowers the cost of producing a raw first demo quickly, but it raises the cost of
   fixing the later errors that come from that raw project.
3. In Week 05 the assistant wrote can_book in seconds, but my first tests missed a fault; only tests
   built from the acceptance criteria found it. Without them the defect would have reached users.
4. In my scenario the most expensive failure is users losing all their stored study materials;
   an automatic backup is cheaper than rebuilding the collection.
5. "Faster generation means lower cost" is true for training projects without real users.

## 8. Appendix B — AI exchanges

<!-- Complete prompts and complete responses, as text — never screenshots. Paste each inside
     the fenced block that follows its label. If a response itself contains ``` lines, open
     and close that block with ~~~~ instead. You may add B4, B5 … after B3 if you ran more. -->

### B1 — Draft (Prompt A)

- **Tool:** (write here)
- **Model:** (write here)
- **Date:** (write here)
- **Purpose:** contextual draft

<!-- Model: the exact model with its version, as the tool shows it (e.g. "GPT-5 Thinking",
     "Claude Sonnet 4.5"). If the tool does not show it, write: not displayed
     Date: YYYY-MM-DD -->

## 9. Appendix C — Evidence tables

### Verification table

<!-- At least two complete rows. Source and locator: title + page / slide / section / chapter,
     or title + URL + access date (YYYY-MM-DD). Decision: keep, qualify or reject — one word. -->

| AI claim | Source and locator | Evidence found | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

### Change log

<!-- At least two substantive revisions. Your final version must differ from the AI wording,
     and the reason must say which evidence or scenario constraint made you change it. -->

| AI wording / suggestion | Your final version | Reason for change |
| --- | --- | --- |
